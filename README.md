# Aviation-Accident-Analysis
Analyzing aviation accidents and incidents to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can improve flight safety. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and supporting files for a data science project on aviation accident analysis

# Aviation Accident Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of aviation accidents and incidents from 1962 to 2023. The goal is to gain insights into the factors contributing to these accidents and to identify trends over time. This analysis is crucial for improving aviation safety measures and preventing future incidents.

## Business Understanding
### Stakeholder
The primary stakeholders for this project are aviation safety regulators, airlines, and aircraft manufacturers. 

### Key Business Questions
1. What are the most common causes of aviation accidents?
2. How have aviation accident rates changed over time?
3. What factors contribute most significantly to fatal accidents?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
### Source of Data
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about aviation accidents and incidents, including the date, location, type of aircraft, number of fatalities and injuries, extent of aircraft damage, weather conditions, and phase of flight.

### Description of Data
- **Date**: The date of the accident
- **Location**: The location where the accident occurred
- **Aircraft**: The type of aircraft involved
- **Fatalities**: The number of fatalities resulting from the accident
- **Injuries**: The number of injuries resulting from the accident
- **Aircraft Damage**: The extent of damage to the aircraft
- **Weather Conditions**: The weather conditions at the time of the accident
- **Phase of Flight**: The phase of flight during which the accident occurred

## Conclusion
### Summary of Conclusions
1. The number of aviation accidents has generally decreased over time, indicating improvements in aviation safety.
2. The most common causes of aviation accidents include pilot error, mechanical failure, and weather conditions.
3. Fatal accidents are more likely to occur during the takeoff and landing phases of flight.


## Organization
The repository is organized with a clear folder structure and clear names of files and folders. The final notebook and presentation are easily located and linked in the README.
